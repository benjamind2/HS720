# Reverse engineering the Holy-Stone HS720
Blog about it: https://puppicornprojects.blogspot.com/

# Summary:
The HS720 is a relatively inexpensive 4K drone of 2022 vintage with features like follow-me, fly-in-circles, GPS route setting, return to home, etc. https://store.holystone.com/products/hs720-4k-gps-drone

It's cute, has lots of features, is shockingly robust, and is relatively inexpensive. Like most inexpensive drones though, it has some ... quirks. This git repo is a collection of my work in reverse-engineering the thing, and the blog is the story and analysis
